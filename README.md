# Implement OOPs
## Task 1: Classes and Their Attributes:
You are working as a software developer for TechShop, a company that sells electronic gadgets. Your
task is to design and implement an application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to
manage customer information, product details, and orders. Below are the classes you need to create:
## Customers Class:
### Attributes:
• CustomerID (int)
• FirstName (string)
• LastName (string)
• Email (string)
• Phone (string)
• Address (string)
### Methods:
• CalculateTotalOrders(): Calculates the total number of orders placed by this customer.
• GetCustomerDetails(): Retrieves and displays detailed information about the customer.
• UpdateCustomerInfo(): Allows the customer to update their information (e.g., email, phone, or
address).
## Products Class:
### Attributes:
• ProductID (int)
• ProductName (string)
• Description (string)
• Price (decimal)
### Methods:
• GetProductDetails(): Retrieves and displays detailed information about the product.
• UpdateProductInfo(): Allows updates to product details (e.g., price, description).
• IsProductInStock(): Checks if the product is currently in stock.
## Orders Class:
### Attributes:
• OrderID (int)
• Customer (Customer) - Use composition to reference the Customer who placed the order.
• OrderDate (DateTime)
• TotalAmount (decimal)
### Methods:
• CalculateTotalAmount() - Calculate the total amount of the order.
• GetOrderDetails(): Retrieves and displays the details of the order (e.g., product list and
quantities).
• UpdateOrderStatus(): Allows updating the status of the order (e.g., processing, shipped).
• CancelOrder(): Cancels the order and adjusts stock levels for products.
## OrderDetails Class:
### Attributes:
• OrderDetailID (int)
• Order (Order) - Use composition to reference the Order to which this detail belongs.
• Product (Product) - Use composition to reference the Product included in the order detail.
• Quantity (int)
### Methods:
• CalculateSubtotal() - Calculate the subtotal for this order detail.
• GetOrderDetailInfo(): Retrieves and displays information about this order detail.
• UpdateQuantity(): Allows updating the quantity of the product in this order detail.
• AddDiscount(): Applies a discount to this order detail.
## Inventory class:
### Attributes:
• InventoryID(int)
• Product (Composition): The product associated with the inventory item.
• QuantityInStock: The quantity of the product currently in stock.
• LastStockUpdate
### Methods:
• GetProduct(): A method to retrieve the product associated with this inventory item.
• GetQuantityInStock(): A method to get the current quantity of the product in stock.
• AddToInventory(int quantity): A method to add a specified quantity of the product to the
inventory.
• RemoveFromInventory(int quantity): A method to remove a specified quantity of the product
from the inventory.
• UpdateStockQuantity(int newQuantity): A method to update the stock quantity to a new value.
• IsProductAvailable(int quantityToCheck): A method to check if a specified quantity of the
product is available in the inventory.

based on their prices and quantities.
• ListLowStockProducts(int threshold): A method to list products with quantities below a specified
threshold, indicating low stock.
• ListOutOfStockProducts(): A method to list products that are out of stock.
• ListAllProducts(): A method to list all products in the inventory, along with their quantities.

## Task 2: Class Creation:
• Create the classes (Customers, Products, Orders, OrderDetails and Inventory) with the specified
attributes.
• Implement the constructor for each class to initialize its attributes.
• Implement methods as specified.

## Task 3: Encapsulation:
• Implement encapsulation by making the attributes private and providing public properties
(getters and setters) for each attribute.
• Add data validation logic to setter methods (e.g., ensure that prices are non-negative, quantities
are positive integers).

## Task 4: Composition:
Ensure that the Order and OrderDetail classes correctly use composition to reference Customer and
Product objects.
### Orders Class with Composition:
o In the Orders class, we want to establish a composition relationship with the Customers
class, indicating that each order is associated with a specific customer.
o In the Orders class, we've added a private attribute customer of type Customers,
establishing a composition relationship. The Customer property provides access to the
Customers object associated with the order.
### OrderDetails Class with Composition:
o Similarly, in the OrderDetails class, we want to establish composition relationships with
both the Orders and Products classes to represent the details of each order, including
the product being ordered.
o In the OrderDetails class, we've added two private attributes, order and product, of
types Orders and Products, respectively, establishing composition relationships. The
Order property provides access to the Orders object associated with the order detail,
and the Product property provides access to the Products object representing the
product in the order detail.
### Customers and Products Classes:
o The Customers and Products classes themselves may not have direct composition
relationships with other classes in this scenario. However, they serve as the basis for
composition relationships in the Orders and OrderDetails classes, respectively.
### Inventory Class:
o The Inventory class represents the inventory of products available for sale. It can have
composition relationships with the Products class to indicate which products are in the
inventory.

## Task 5: Exceptions handling

###  Data Validation:

o Challenge: Validate user inputs and data from external sources (e.g., user registration,
order placement).
o Scenario: When a user enters an invalid email address during registration.
o Exception Handling: Throw a custom InvalidDataException with a clear error message.
###  Inventory Management:
o Challenge: Handling inventory-related issues, such as selling more products than are in
stock.
o Scenario: When processing an order with a quantity that exceeds the available stock.
o Exception Handling: Throw an InsufficientStockException and update the order status
accordingly.
###  Order Processing:
o Challenge: Ensuring the order details are consistent and complete before processing.
o Scenario: When an order detail lacks a product reference.
o Exception Handling: Throw an IncompleteOrderException with a message explaining the
issue.
###  Payment Processing:
o Challenge: Handling payment failures or declined transactions.
o Scenario: When processing a payment for an order and the payment is declined.
o Exception Handling: Handle payment-specific exceptions (e.g., PaymentFailedException)
and initiate retry or cancellation processes.
###  File I/O (e.g., Logging):
o Challenge: Logging errors and events to files or databases.
o Scenario: When an error occurs during data persistence (e.g., writing a log entry).
o Exception Handling: Handle file I/O exceptions (e.g., IOException) and log them
appropriately.
###  Database Access:
o Challenge: Managing database connections and queries.
o Scenario: When executing a SQL query and the database is offline.
o Exception Handling: Handle database-specific exceptions (e.g., SqlException) and
implement connection retries or failover mechanisms.
###  Concurrency Control:
o Challenge: Preventing data corruption in multi-user scenarios.
o Scenario: When two users simultaneously attempt to update the same order.
o Exception Handling: Implement optimistic concurrency control and handle
ConcurrencyException by notifying users to retry.
###  Security and Authentication:
o Challenge: Ensuring secure access and handling unauthorized access attempts.
o Scenario: When a user tries to access sensitive information without proper
authentication.
o Exception Handling: Implement custom AuthenticationException and
AuthorizationException to handle security-related issues.
